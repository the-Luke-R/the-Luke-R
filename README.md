Programming empowers people: don't like something in an app? Just go in there and change the code. Not a fan of a feature in a game? Remove it or modify it. Have an idea that will make people's lives easier or change the world and no one has done it yet? Well, what are you waiting for?

These days, empowerment is a frequent topic, and programming is no exception. The time you're willing to invest, the time you're willing to learn, study, your capacity, your learningâ€”it all depends solely on you, and that's fair.

## About me

Hello, visitor, my name is Lucas Rosada, also known as the-Luke-R, and I'm a back-end programmer. I'm passionate about development, creating programs, machine learning, image generation, video creation/editing, moding games, and streamlining processes. I work on projects in my spare time, some of which involve AI.
